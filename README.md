# Notes


### This is my personal portfolio.<br/><br/>

- This project focuses on interaction and layout behavior. Some decisions favor faster iteration over rigid abstraction.

- The goal is to understand how the interface behaves in practice, not to optimize for perfect structure upfront.

Built with React, Vite, and Three.js.
